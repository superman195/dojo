# Mining

There are two options in setting up a miner for Dojo (centralised method and decentralised method)

Before starting, create a .env file by making a copy of .env.example

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Option 1: Centralised Method

Complete the .env file by changing / uncommenting the required variables

| Variable            | Description                                                       | Default Value                               | Remarks                                                                                                                                                     |

Run Dojo CLI to retrieve API Key and Subscription Key. See [Dojo CLI](#dojo-cli) for usage. Note down the API key, subscription key and append the API key to your .env file.

> You can use tab completions to see a list of commands

```bash
make dojo-cli

# Authenticate and generate keys
authenticate
api_key generate
subscription_key generate

# List all keys
api_key list
subscription_key list
```

Start the miner by running the following commands

```bash
make miner
```

Start the dojo platform which Dojo CLI will interact with later.

```bash
make dojo-platform
```

Refer to [option 1](#option-1-centralised-method) to continue setting up the miner.

### Setup Subscription Key for Labellers on UI to connect to Dojo Subnet for scoring

Note: URLs are different for testnet and mainnet. Please refer to [docs](https://docs.tensorplex.ai/tensorplex-docs/tensorplex-dojo-testnet/official-links).

1. Head to https://dojo.tensorplex.ai or https://dojo-testnet.tensorplex.ai and login and sign with your Metamask wallet.

- You'll see an empty homepage with no Tasks, and a "Connect" button on the top right ![image](./assets/ui/homepage.png)
- Click on "Connect" and you'll see a popup with different wallets for you to connect to ![image](./assets/ui/wallet_popup.jpg)
- Click "Next" and "Continue", then finally it will be requesting a signature from your wallet, please sign and it will be connected. ![image](./assets/ui/wallet_sign.jpg)
- Once connected, the top navigation bar should display your wallet address. ![image](./assets/ui/wallet_connected.png)

2. Once connected, please stay connected to your wallet and click on "Enter Subscription Key". ![image](./assets/subscription/enter_subscription.png)

- Give your subscription a name, and enter your subscription key generated earlier before running the miner. _*Refer to step 4 of "Getting Started" if you need to retrieve your key*_ ![image](./assets/subscription/enter_details.png)
- Click "Create" and your subscription will be saved. ![image](./assets/subscription/created_details.png)
- Confirmed your subscription is created properly, and that you can view your tasks! ![image](./assets/subscription/tasks_shown.png)

# Dojo CLI

We provide a CLI that allows miners to manage their API and subscription keys either when connecting to our hosted Tensorplex API services or their own self-hosted miner backend.

Features:

- Tab completion
- Prefix matching wallets

You may use the dockerized version of the CLI using

```bash
make dojo-cli
```

Alternatively you can simply run the CLI inside of a virtual environment

```bash
# Start the dojo cli tool
# Upon starting the CLI it will ask if you wanna use the default path for bittensor wallets, which is `~/.bittensor/wallets/`.
# If you want to use a different path, please enter 'n' and then specify the path when prompted.
dojo

# TIP: During the whole process, you could actually use tab-completion to display the options, so you don't have to remember them all. Please TAB your way guys! 🙇‍♂️
# It should be prompting you to enter you coldkey and hotkey
# After entering the coldkey and hotkey, you should be in the command line interface for dojo, please authenticate by running the following command.
# You should see a message saying "✅ Wallet coldkey name and hotkey name set successfully."
authenticate

# Afterwards, please generate an API Key with the following command.
# You should see a message saying:  "✅ All API keys: ['sk-<KEY>]". Displaying a list of your API Keys.
api_key generate

# Lastly, please generate a Subscription Key with the following command.
# You should see a message saying:  "✅ All Subscription keys: ['sk-<KEY>]". Displaying a list of your Subscription Keys.
subscription_key generate

# :rocket: You should now have all the required keys, and be able to start mining.

# Other commands available to the CLI:
# You can always run the following command to get your current keys.
api_key list
subscription_key list

# You can also delete your keys with the following commands.
api_key delete
subscription_key delete
```

## Auto-updates with Watchtower

It is recommended to run watchtower alongside your miner to automatically keep your containers up-to-date. Watchtower monitors running containers and automatically pulls and recreates them when it detects that the image has changed.

To start watchtower:

```bash
make watchtower
```

To stop watchtower:

```bash
make watchtower-down
```
